## Agenda
welcome


## Introduction to Neural Networks

## Definition and Basic Concepts
- Neural Networks, AI, and ML
- [Glossary](https://aiforhumanists.com/glossary/)

## Historical Development
- Key milestones
- Resources for further reading

## Importance & Applications
- Digital Humanities and North Campus disciplines
- Current research and use cases at UCLA


## Strengths and Limitations

## What AI is Good At
- Pattern recognition
- Language processing
- Image analysis

## What AI is NOT Good At
- In-depth analysis
- Contextual understanding
- Nuanced interpretation

## GoFAI vs. Generative AI


## Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview
- Key components (Transformers, Attention Mechanisms)
- Training processes and dataset types

## Popular LLMs
- GPT-3, BERT

## Applications in Digital Humanities
- Text analysis, translation, content generation
- Case Study: [Literary Event Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01140)


## How LLMs Can Help

## Use Cases
- Brainstorming and outlining
- Prompt engineering for better AI responses

## Demos
- Outline an AI presentation
- AI-assisted code generation
- Pleiades to Neo4j workflows
- NLP Twitter / Bluesky data

## Issues
- Generated essays & ghost citations
- Ethical concerns


## Large Vision Models (LVMs) & Vision Language Models (VLMs)

## Overview
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Popular Models
- DALL-E, CLIP

## Applications in Digital Humanities
- Image recognition & artwork restoration
- Example: [Leonardo Impett’s work](https://dahj.org/article/imgsai)

## How AI "Sees"
- Handwriting analysis
- Case Study: Alexander Hamilton & George Washington Papers ([HAT tool](https://www.csmc.uni-hamburg.de/publications/software/hat.html))



## Future of AI & ML in Digital Humanities

## Fine-Tuning AI for Humanities Research
- Domain expertise in model refinement
- Example: Human Pose Estimation (Bernasconi et al., 2023)

## Technical Barriers
- AI-assisted tools like Microsoft's Co-Pilot
- Accessibility and skill development


## Open vs. Closed AI

## Key Definitions
- Open AI (e.g., open-source models)
- Closed AI (e.g., proprietary systems)

## Implications
- Innovation, accessibility, and security concerns
- [Ollama: Local AI](https://ollama.com/)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Ethical & Privacy Concerns
- AI decision-making in banking, housing, credit

---

## Ethical Concerns

## Trust & Authenticity
- AI’s role in misinformation/disinformation
- Deepfakes & synthetic media
- Detection & prevention strategies

## Bias & Fairness
- Algorithmic bias (Joy Buolamwini's research)
- Mitigation strategies & ethical data collection

## Academic Integrity
- AI-generated content accuracy
- Copyright & ownership debates



## Future Directions & Trends

## Emerging Technologies
- Advances in neural networks
- AI’s evolving role in Digital Humanities

## Ethical AI at UCLA
- [Chris Mattmann’s AI Resources](https://adminvc.ucla.edu/blog/artificial-intelligence-faqs)
- [Generative AI at UCLA](https://it.ucla.edu/news/new-resource-generative-ai-ucla)

## Further Learning
- Courses, articles, and bibliography


## Discussion & Questions
